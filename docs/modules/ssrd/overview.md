# SSRD

SSRD (Self-Service Request Dashboard) is our central platform for managing modules. It provides the tooling needed to streamline module registration, release management, and related services.

- [Registering Modules](/docs/modules/ssrd/registering-modules)
- [Additional Services](/docs/modules/ssrd/additional-services)

:::info Want Access?
Module developers should request a contributor account that grants access to a portal (SSRD) for submitting modules. The portal lets you manage releases, release notes, and module profiles more easily.

Please reach out to Freesnöw#0001 on Discord to request access.
