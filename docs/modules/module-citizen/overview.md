:::caution tl;dr
Blish HUD has tens of thousands of daily users, resulting in thousands of module downloads.
Keep those users in mind when publishing changes that may inadvertently affect them.
By publishing through the public repo you agree to follow the recommendations in these module citizen guides.
:::

Blish HUD can run with any combination of modules on a wide range of systems and configurations, so each module must behave as reliably as it can.  These guides explain how to fit in with other modules, use key APIs effectively, respect resource usage, and more—a handbook for being a great "module citizen."

While these guides are recommendations rather than requirements, use them as a reference for delivering the best experience to users of your module and others.  As we learn more and improve our APIs, we will update the guides to reflect that experience.
