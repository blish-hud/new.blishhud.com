# Issue
RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) shows the on-screen-display (OSD), e.g. FPS, twice and overlapped. That happens because RTSS injects itself not only into Guild Wars 2 but as well into Blish HUD.

# Solution
In RTSS in the global profile set 'Application Detection Level' to 'None' . Add Guild Wars 2 exe as a new Profile and set 'Application Detection Level' to 'Low' for that profile.
