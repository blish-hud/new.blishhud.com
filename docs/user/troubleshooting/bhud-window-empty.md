# Solution

This is typically caused by Blish HUD missing some resource files (those stored within the Content folder).

1. Redownload Blish HUD.
2. Right-click the .zip file and select **Properties**.
3. Select the **Unblock** checkbox (if one is shown) and select **OK**.  If this checkbox is not shown, then you can ignore this step.
4. Extract the entire ZIP to a safe location.
5. Open Blish HUD again.

Blish HUD should now function as expected.
