:::warning Deutsche Telekom AG (DTAG) Peering

We've come to learn that Deutsche Telekom AG customers may experience extreme slowness or timeouts when accessing our domains. This is due to a long-standing peering dispute between DTAG and Cloudflare.

**Possible Workarounds:**
* **Use a VPN:** This changes your routing path and typically resolves the issue immediately.
* **Switch to Mobile Data:** If your mobile provider is not DTAG (e.g., O2 or Vodafone), it may load instantly.

## Understanding Your Results

The top right of each tile will indicate the amount of time (in milliseconds) a resource took to load.  If you're seeing times greater than 1000ms (1 second) there may be an issue with routing to our servers from your internet service provider.  If any of the requests fail (even on retry), your internet service provider may be blocking the request.
