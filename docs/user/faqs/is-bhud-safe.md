:::info tl;dr
We work hard to follow ArenaNet’s policies, but ultimately, using any third-party tool is at your own risk.  Please review their policies below and use your best judgment.
:::

The Blish HUD team takes ArenaNet’s policies seriously. We developed this overlay out of a love for the game, and we have no interest in creating tools that would put players' accounts at risk. While several ArenaNet employees have used Blish HUD and others have provided feedback that has shaped its development, this does not constitute official approval.

Blish HUD is a framework. On its own, it provides no gameplay-altering functionality and is compliant with terms of service.  Further:
- We design our framework and APIs to encourage compliance with ArenaNet’s policies.
- The modules hosted in our repository have been vetted to help ensure they stay within the bounds of ArenaNet's policies.
- ArenaNet generally allows tools that do not provide a competitive advantage for one player over another, but they reserve the right to change their stance at any time.

That all said, it is your responsibility as a user to review the related Guild Wars 2 policies, which we have linked below, and use good judgement when deciding on the modules you choose to install and use.

The Third-Party Programs policy provides two rather important things to note:

> [...] we are aware that some utilities help players without affecting others; that is, they do not give one player an advantage over another. While, in general, we will not take action on an account for the use of such a utility program or modification, action is subject to ArenaNet's discretion. You use any third-party program at your own risk.

> Note: ArenaNet does not review, approve, or endorse any third-party program. Each use of such a program is made by an account holder at their own risk.

**If you believe a specific module or feature violates ArenaNet’s policies, please report it to us on Discord.**
