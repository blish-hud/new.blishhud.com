# Privacy Policy
**Last updated: December 13, 2025**

:::info Overview
We collect a minimal amount of information necessary to operate, secure, and maintain our website and associated services. We do not use tracking cookies, advertising analytics, user profiling, or marketing telemetry. We may use essential local storage solely to remember your display preferences on our website.
:::

## Information We Collect

### Server Log Data

When you access our website or services, our servers automatically record standard access log information as part of normal web server operation. This may include:

- IP address
- Request path and method
- Response status code
- Timestamp
- Response time
- User agent

IP addresses and user agent strings may be considered personal data under certain privacy laws. We process this data only as described in this policy.

We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or account credentials unless you explicitly provide them (for example, by contacting us).

### Infrastructure and Content Delivery

To ensure the security and reliability of our services, we use third-party infrastructure providers.
- **Cloudflare:** We use Cloudflare to protect our website from attacks and to improve performance. Cloudflare may process access data (such as IP addresses) to provide these security services. [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)
- **GitHub:** Application updates and module downloads are delivered directly from GitHub's infrastructure. When you download these files, your request is handled by GitHub. [GitHub’s Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

## Purpose of Processing

We process server log data solely for the following purposes:
- Ensuring service reliability and availability
- Debugging and diagnosing technical issues
- Monitoring performance and capacity
- Detecting and preventing abuse or security incidents

We do not use this data for advertising, behavioral tracking, or marketing.

## Legal Basis

Where applicable (including under the GDPR), processing is based on our legitimate interest in operating, maintaining, and securing our services. Processing is limited to what is necessary and proportionate for those purposes.

Data Retention Raw server log data is retained for a limited period, typically no longer than 30 days, unless a longer retention period is required for security investigations or legal obligations. Aggregated or anonymized metrics may be retained for longer periods.

## Data Sharing 

We do not sell or rent personal data.

**Service Providers:** We engage trusted third-party providers to host our web servers and provide security (CDN) services. These providers process data only to the extent necessary to deliver the infrastructure.

**Log Analysis:** Raw server logs are forwarded to and processed on privately owned, self-hosted infrastructure managed directly by us. We do not share these logs with external parties unless required by law.

## Blish HUD Application Traffic

The Blish HUD application communicates with our servers to provide functionality and updates. Requests made by the application are subject to the same server logging described above. No additional tracking, profiling, or telemetry is performed by the core application.

## Third-Party Modules

Blish HUD allows users to install modules created by third-party developers. This Privacy Policy applies only to the core Blish HUD application and services provided directly by us. Third-party modules are not operated by us and may collect their own data.

## Children’s Privacy

Our services are not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access or request deletion of personal data. Because server logs are short-lived, technical in nature, and not linked to user accounts, fulfilling access or deletion requests may not always be feasible. You may contact us with any concerns.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
